# Idea 001 — Perpetual Futures Profile View

**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Status:** Draft

## What the idea is

Create a detailed profile view for perpetual futures traders that shows their trading history, PNL, fees paid, funding costs, and volume statistics in an easy-to-understand dashboard.

## Why it matters

Traders need to understand the full cost breakdown of their perps trading activity, including not just PNL but also the fees and funding payments that eat into profits. A trader with $37K volume and -$48 PNL might think they're close to break-even, but without seeing fees and funding separately, they can't properly assess their trading performance and cost efficiency.

## Rough steps

1. Design a profile dashboard showing total volume, realized PNL, fees paid, and funding paid/received
2. Create filters for time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, custom range)
3. Add visualizations showing fee vs funding cost ratios compared to trading gains/losses
4. Include breakdown of funding rate exposure during different market conditions
